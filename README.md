A Python project that creates specialized **LLM-based AI agents** to analyze complex medical cases.  
The system integrates insights from different medical specialists to provide comprehensive assessments  
and suggested treatment directions, demonstrating the potential of AI in multidisciplinary medicine.

#  How It Works

In the current version, we use **six specialist AI agents** and one coordinating agent.  
A medical report is passed to all agents, which run **in parallel (threading)** and return their findings.  
The outputs are then combined and summarized into **three most probable health issues** with reasoning.

## AI Agents

**1. Cardiologist Agent**  
- *Focus*: Detect cardiac issues such as arrhythmias or structural abnormalities.  
- *Recommendations*: Cardiovascular testing, monitoring, and management strategies.  

**2. Psychologist Agent**  
- *Focus*: Identify psychological conditions (e.g., panic disorder, anxiety).  
- *Recommendations*: Therapy, stress management, or medication adjustments.  

**3. Pulmonologist Agent**  
- *Focus*: Assess respiratory causes for symptoms (e.g., asthma, breathing disorders).  
- *Recommendations*: Lung function tests, breathing exercises, respiratory treatments.  

**4. Neurologist Agent**  
- *Focus*: Identify neurological disorders (e.g., headaches, neuropathy).  

**5. Gastroenterologist Agent**  
- *Focus*: Digestive system issues (e.g., GERD, IBS).  

**6. Oncologist Agent**  
- *Focus*: Scan for malignancy signs.  

**7. MultidisciplinaryTeam Agent**  
- *Focus*: Consolidates all specialist reports into top 3 probable health concerns.
