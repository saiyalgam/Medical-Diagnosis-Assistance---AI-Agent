Gastrointestinal Malignancy – Unintended weight loss of 15 lbs and persistent abdominal pain with anemia are "red flag" symptoms that require ruling out colon or stomach cancer.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) – Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), fevers, and abdominal tenderness are consistent with Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis.

Depressive Disorder – Chronic fatigue and reports of "feeling worried" may indicate depression, but physical causes (cancer/IBD) must be treated first.
