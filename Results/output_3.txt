Generalized Anxiety/Depression – The complaint of "just not feeling right" without physical localization often points to a psychosomatic or mood disorder.

Viral Prodrome – Sudden onset of malaise can indicate the early stages of a viral infection (flu/mononucleosis).

Metabolic Imbalance – Without labs, dehydration or electrolyte issues cannot be ruled out as a cause for general malaise. Recommendation: Obtain Vitals Immediately.
